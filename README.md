# serverd to tsuserver3
python3 and pyyaml required

just replace base folder with base folder from your serverD, and 'config_sample' folder with 'config_sample' folder from tsuserver3 folder where u want to migrate. Then you need just place appeared 'config' folder in your tsuserver3 folder. Hope it works :^)
